  Trigger when writing, reviewing, or debugging Laravel code. Enforces framework conventions:
  thin controllers, Form Requests for validation, Eloquent over raw queries, and proper use of
  built-in features. Also trigger on questions about Laravel architecture or "how do I do X in Laravel".
---

## Core conventions
- Use Eloquent over raw queries; use query scopes for reusable filters
- Controllers stay thin — move business logic to Service classes
- Use Form Requests for validation, never validate in controllers directly

## Gotchas
- Soft-deleted models require `withTrashed()` or results silently exclude them
- `->get()` always returns a Collection, never null — check `->isEmpty()` not null
- Mass assignment requires `$fillable` or `$guarded` — forgetting causes silent failures
